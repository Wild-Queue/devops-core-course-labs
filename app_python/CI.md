Best Practices for CI Workflow:

The best practices from this git workflow are:

1. Use a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow: The workflow is triggered on push events to the ```main``` and ```lab3``` branches, as well as pull request events to the ```main``` branch. This ensures that code is tested and built automatically whenever changes are made.

2. Checkout code: The workflow starts by checking out the code from the repository using the ```actions/checkout``` action.

3. Set up Python: The workflow sets up the Python environment using the ```actions/setup-python``` action. The workflow caches the Python dependencies using ```actions/setup-python```

4. Install dependencies: The workflow installs the Python dependencies using ```pip```. It first upgrades pip and then installs the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file.

5. Cache Snyk CLI: The workflow caches the Snyk CLI tool using the ```actions/cache``` action.

6. Install Snyk CLI: If the Snyk CLI tool is not already cached, the workflow installs it using ```npm```. This ensures that the CLI tool is available for vulnerability scanning.

7. Run Snyk: The workflow runs Snyk to test for vulnerabilities in all projects. The snyk test command is used with the ```--all-projects``` flag to scan all projects in the repository. A severity threshold of ```high``` is set to fail the workflow if high severity vulnerabilities are found.

8. Linter: The workflow installs and runs Flake8, a linter for Python code. 

9. Tests: The workflow runs unit tests using the unittest module.

10. Fix Snyk vulnerabilities: If there are any Snyk vulnerabilities found, the workflow runs the Snyk wizard to fix them. 

11. Login using secrets: The Docker username and password and Snyk token are stored as secrets in the repository.
