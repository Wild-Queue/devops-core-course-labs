# Time Server

A simple HTTP server that displays the current time in Moscow.

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

5. The server will start running on port 8008.
6. Open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008).
7. The page will display the current time in Moscow.

### Notes

- The server uses the `datetime` module to get the current time.
- The server responds with a simple HTML page displaying the current time in Moscow.
- The server runs indefinitely until it is manually stopped.
