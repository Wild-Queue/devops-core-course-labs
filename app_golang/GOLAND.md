Best practices :

1. Separation of Concerns: The code is structured with a main function and a handler function for the HTTP request/response. This separation allows for easier code maintenance and reusability.

2. Error Handling: Errors are properly handled and returned as HTTP error responses with appropriate status codes. This helps to provide clear and informative error messages to clients.

3. Logging: The log package is used to log fatal errors. This ensures that any critical errors are logged and can be easily identified for debugging purposes.

4. Use of Timezone: The application correctly uses the time package to retrieve the current time in the Europe/Moscow timezone. This ensures that the displayed time is accurate and consistent.

5. Security: Although not explicitly shown in the given code, it is important to mention that best practices for web application security, such as input validation, sanitization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), should also be implemented.

6. Code Documentation: The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each function and package imports. This helps improve code readability and allows other developers to understand the codebase more easily.
