## Best Practices for CI golang Workflow:

1. Code Repository: The CI process is triggered when changes are pushed to the "main" or "lab4" branches or when a pull request is made against the "main" branch.

2. Workflow Configuration: The CI process is configured using a YAML file. The "on" section defines the events that trigger the workflow, and the "jobs" section defines the steps that need to be executed.

3. Code Checkout: The workflow starts by checking out the code from the repository using the "actions/checkout" action. 

4. Environment Setup: The "actions/setup-go" action sets up the Go programming language environment.

5. Dependency Management: The "go mod download" command is used to install project dependencies. 

6. Security Testing: The Snyk CLI is installed using the "npm install -g snyk" command. 

7. Code Linting: The "golangci-lint run" command is used to run a linter on the Go code.

8. Unit Testing: The "go test" command is executed in the "./../app_golang" directory to run the unit tests for the Go application. 

9. Vulnerability Fixing: The "snyk wizard" command is used to fix Snyk vulnerabilities across all projects. 

10. Containerization: The Docker Hub login details are stored in secrets. The "docker/login-action" action is used to authenticate with Docker Hub.
