## Best Practices for CI golang Workflow:

1. Version control: The code is checked out from the repository using the "actions/checkout" action. 

2. Dependency management: The Go dependencies are managed using Go modules. 

3. Security testing: The Snyk CLI is installed using the "npm install -g snyk" command. The Snyk API is authenticated using the "snyk config set api=${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}" command. The "snyk test" command is used to run security tests on the code and check for vulnerabilities.

4. Linting: The "go fmt" command is used to run the linter and ensure code formatting is consistent.

5. Unit tests: The "go test" command is used to run unit tests on the code.

6. Fixing vulnerabilities: The "snyk wizard" command is used to fix any Snyk vulnerabilities found during testing.

7. Docker image building and pushing: The Docker image is built using the "docker/build-push-action" action.
